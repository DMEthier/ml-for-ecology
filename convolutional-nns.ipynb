    "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) refer to a particular kind of neural network architecture that has proved enormously successful in dealing with data in which the input features exhibit some kind of spatial or temporal ordering. A surprisingly large number of data sets and applications fall into this category. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Images** display spatial ordering. We expect pixel values in nearby pixels to be similar, and if they are not similar this tells us something valuable (for example, that we have encountered an edge)\n",
    "- **Audio** or **acoustic** data displays temporal ordering. In music for example, the *sequence* of notes conveys important information. If you randomly reorder the notes in a symphony, you most likely end up with something that sounds very different, and very much worse, than the original. \n",
    "- **Text** data is also ordered \"temporally\", in the same way that audio is. We have seen that bag-of-words models can give good predictive results, but it would be no surprise to learn that better results can be obtained if we look at the order in which words are combined.\n",
    "- **Video** data is both spatially and temporally ordered: it is a collection of images ordered through time.\n",
    "\n",
    "CNNs are designed to exploit the structure of ordered data. Their fundamental building block is the *convolution filter*, a small matrix of coefficients or \"mask\" that is placed \"on top\" the ordered data and slid \"along\" the data in the direction given by the natural ordering. At each step, the coefficients in the convolution filter are multiplied with the data they are currently sitting on top of, and this multiplication can amplify or dampen the features in the data in a vast number of ways. This is the way CNNs extract \"meaning\" from data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each layer in a CNN consists of a user-specified number of these convolution filters, plus some additional operations and transformations. The output of one layer forms the input to the next. In this way the convolution filters in one layer operate on the outputs of convolution filters in the previous layer. In practice, this means that convolution filters in early layers tend to detect very simple patterns (like edges in images) and later layers combine these patterns into something much more elaborate (the letter \"E\", or a face, for example). For this reason most CNNs are deep CNNs - they have several hidden layers between their input and output layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows you how to fit CNNs to data in R. As in the previous lesson, there are two main goals: **understanding** what is going on in a CNN, which we'll do by looking at a spreadsheet example, and **implementing** CNNs on a larger scale.\n",
