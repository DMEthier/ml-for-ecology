# Machine learning for ecology

This repo contains material for the "Machine learning for ecology" workshop. The workshop aims to give a practical introduction to the use of machine learning methods for classification problems in ecology. 

It is aimed at ecologists doing some form of classification - either manually or model-based - in their own research work, especially those classifying images or audio/acoustic data. 

The workshop covers two machine learning methodologies: tree-based methods, and neural networks. All analysis will be done using R, using existing packages for tree-based methods (rpart, randomForest, gbm) and neural networks (keras).

Upcoming workshop dates:
* 23-25 October 2017 @ Centre for Ecological Sciences, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore
* 20-22 November 2017 @ African Institute for Mathematical Sciences, Cape Town
